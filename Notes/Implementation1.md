Implementing an English to Chinese dictionary using a red-black tree to enable simultaneous searching between English and Chinese can be a bit challenging due to the bidirectional nature of the dictionary. Red-black trees are typically used for single-directional key-value mappings. To achieve bidirectional search functionality, you can consider the following approach:

1. **Dual Trees**: You can use two separate red-black trees, one for English to Chinese mapping and the other for Chinese to English mapping. Each node in these trees will store the word (either English or Chinese) as a key and its translation as the associated value. This way, you can perform searches in both directions.

2. **Synchronization**: When adding entries to the dictionary, you need to ensure that the two trees stay synchronized. If you add an English word and its Chinese translation, you must also add the Chinese word and its English translation. This ensures consistency between the two trees.

Here's a simplified Python example of how you could implement this:

```python
class BilingualDictionary:
    def __init__(self):
        self.en_to_cn_tree = RedBlackTree()
        self.cn_to_en_tree = RedBlackTree()

    def add_translation(self, english_word, chinese_word):
        self.en_to_cn_tree.insert(english_word, chinese_word)
        self.cn_to_en_tree.insert(chinese_word, english_word)

    def search_english(self, english_word):
        return self.en_to_cn_tree.search(english_word)

    def search_chinese(self, chinese_word):
        return self.cn_to_en_tree.search(chinese_word)
```

In the above example, `RedBlackTree` is an abstract data type that represents a red-black tree. You'll need to implement methods like `insert` and `search` for this data structure.

Remember that maintaining the synchronization of these two trees is crucial. Whenever you add, update, or delete an entry in one tree, you must ensure that the corresponding operation is performed in the other tree to keep the dictionary bidirectional and consistent.

This approach allows for simultaneous searching between English and Chinese in both directions, but it also requires careful management to keep the two trees synchronized. Additionally, you'll need to consider how to handle cases where there are multiple translations for a single word in both languages, which can complicate the data structure and search algorithms.
